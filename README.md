Handy Uploader to s3 for use with Lambda - keeps original filename

Graciously adapted from this Medium post: https://medium.com/@mikemccall10/walkthrough-upload-images-to-s3-using-angular-and-lambda-724c2d9f8263

This is an example of a file uploader to s3, that I have used in my Angular5 Projects to keep my credentials safe.

Inside the Angular5 project, I store the file name, and then retrieve it by using an environment variable to store the route.
